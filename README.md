#Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

#Comments
- When running the HTML through the validator, there was an error with the time element-- not allowed. Not exactly sure why because it was typed exactly how it was in the lecture. 
- With the CSS validation, there was an error with
"html { }." Again, not quite sure why since it was exactly the same as the lecture video :/
- The device emulator didn't seem to work for me? Whenever I selected a device, it didn't drop the sidebar below the main content. However, if I adjusted the size of the browswer, it always worked. 
- I adjusted the margin of the aside so that the background image would cover the content because if not, the main content would be half on the background image and half on the background color. The footer would also hangout in the aside. If you can explain how to make the correction, I'd greatly appreciate it!
- Also, if I added the float: left to the aside, it would take away the background image. Suggestions on how to fix that is also appreciated.
